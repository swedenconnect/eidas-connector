The Swedish eIDAS Connector is an Open Source component, and is being used as an eIDAS connector for the Swedish participation of the [eIDAS federation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation).

The Swedish eIDAS Connector is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application built on top of the [Spring Security SAML Identity Provider](https://github.com/swedenconnect/saml-identity-provider) library. It acts as a SAML Identity Provider in the [Sweden Connect](https://www.swedenconnect.se) federation, and as a SAML Service Provider against the eIDAS federation.

Go to <https://docs.swedenconnect.se/eidas-connector> for a set of resources for configuration, deployment and maintenance of the service.
